# Todo

## Secure the database

The passwords currently in the database aren't hashed!

- [ ] In `db/scripts` you'll find a file called `hashPasswords.js`

- [ ] In this file, write code to read in a list of all users currently in the
      database.

- [ ] Loop through the list, and use `bcrypt.hash()` to hash each password.

- [ ] Replace each user's plaintext password in the database with the hashed
      password.

- [ ] Check the database to make sure the passwords appear to be hashed.

> [!WARNING]
>
> running this script twice will hash the hash of the password! If you want to
> run it again, you should do `npm run db:reset` to reset the passwords to their
> raw form, first.

## Update POST /users

The `POST /users` endpoint is still storing raw passwords in the database. Let's
fix that.

- [ ] Find the `user.controller.js` file

- [ ] Read the `createUser` function to understand what it is doing

- [ ] Before the password is stored in the database, make sure to hash it with
      `bcrypt.hash()`

- [ ] Manually test the `POST /users` endpoint to make sure it is hashing before
      creating the user. Fill out the new user form and check out the new row in
      the database.

## Update GET /todos

The `GET /todos` endpoint is broken, because it is now trying to compare raw
passwords in the request with hashed passwords in the database.

- [ ] Try viewing the todos of a user to see that it's broken

- [ ] Find the `todo.controller.js` file

- [ ] Read the `getUserTodos` function to understand what it is doing

- [ ] Instead of comparing the database password to the request password
      directly, use `bcrypt.compare()`

- [ ] Try viewing the user's todos again - it should work now

## Add POST /todos

Finally, let's add a new page allowing the logged in user to create a new todo.

- [ ] In `views/todos` make a `new.ejs` file and create a form which adds a new
      todo. It should make a `POST` request to the `/todos` endpoint.

- [ ] Attach a controller to the `GET /todos/new` route in `todo.routes.js`
      which renders the form.

- [ ] In `todo.controller.js`, add a `createTodo` function. It should verify the
      username and password of the creating user, much in the same way that
      `GET /todos` does (in fact, you could probably copy some of the code).

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  >
  > If authentication fails, set the status to `401` and set the
  > `WWW-Authenticate` header to `Basic realm="cryptodo"`. This is what makes
  > the browser show the login dialogue.

- [ ] Attach the `createTodo` function to the `POST /todos` route in the
      `todo.routes.js` file.

Try out your form. Make sure the todo gets created and is correctly associated
with the logged in user.

## Extension: middleware

If you get through everything and need an extra challenge, notice that the code
which checks the user password gets repeated in `renderUserTodos` and again in
`createTodo`.

This could be extracted to a
[middleware function](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html).

If we named our function `protected`, it might look like this:

```js
// middleware/protected.js
const protected = (req, res, next) => {
  // TODO: check the password
}
```

Then we could use it like this:

```js
// routes/todo.routes.js
app.get('/todos', protected, renderUserTodos)
app.post('/todos', protected, createTodo)
```

This is a powerful pattern which makes it easy to password-protect any endpoint
in the app.
